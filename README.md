IOS-tutorials
=============

Why this tutorial series is different?
there are tons of tutorials on the internet for free. but if you look closely you will find that most of them have very limited scope.
So after watching the full video you will have to search again and integrate the code of all tutorials you have watched.This costs you
a lot of time and energy.
       
This is where we come into picture. we will provide:-

1) All the features at one place.

2) All source code will be free.

3) step by step guide for each tutorial at guruofgadget.wordpress.com

4) videos and new tutorials added every week.

5) tutorials will cover basic for beginers.

6) algorithm and design procedure will be shared.

7) suggestions are welcome.

This tutorial series is about full featured and customised ios tutorials. so you wont need to search all over internet to 
do what you want. You can suggest the features you want in a particular feature and we will try our best to add those at the earliest.

Note :- We take full precaution to maintain the standard of the tutorials and the code however Use and modify the code at your own risk.
